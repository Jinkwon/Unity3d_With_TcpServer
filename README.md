Unity3d With NodeJs TcpServer
======================
Connect Unity3D to NodeJs TCPServer

This project is about implementing communicating TCP Node Server and Unity3D.  
You should install in your PC, and run Command (node TcpServer/server.js)  
(You can install nodejs platform from here : http://nodejs.org/)  
  
I tested on Unity 3.5 Version.
